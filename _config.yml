  Hello, I'm primarily a software developer. At university I was vice president of the MacEwan computer science club. as vice president I helped 
  get students engaged in the computer science club, raising the club membership from around 10 to over 100 people in a couple months. Furthermore, I organized
  meetings and club sponsered computer science events/talks. 
  
  I volunteer at the University of Alberta helping the Alberta Sat team build there satelite. I have written a file transfer protocol that we plan
  to use to send and receive files from it.
